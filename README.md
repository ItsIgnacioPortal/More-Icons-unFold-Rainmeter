## What are the unFold skins? :computer:

## Pre-requirements :clipboard:
Things you need to use this skins on your desktop.

* Enough space on your disk to clone or download the skins.
* Know the path where the skins of Rainmeter are located.
## Installation :wrench:
Next, the steps you need to follow in order to install any button of here are:
1. **Clone** or **download** this project.
2. **Select** the folder of the button you want to add on your desktop.
3. **Paste** the folder in the Skins of Rainmeter in the folder "unFold" (if you still don't have the others unFold buttons you can download them [here](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449)).
4. **Enter** into the folder of the button and select the type of button you want.
5. Depending on the type of button (Black, Transparent or White), you need to **copy** the image and **paste** it into the folder "@Resources/Buttons".
6. Now, just **open** Rainmeter, **search** unFold and **load** the button you want. You can change the position of it but this kind of buttons are always in the border right or left of the dektop.
7. If the path of a button doesn't work, probably you should **edit** the file (in each file it has on the top a comment that indicate where you need to change the path) and **write** the correct path of your program.

Now, if you want to try to do your own button you can check the Button Templete in this repository and modify the files of the "Create a new Button" folder.
