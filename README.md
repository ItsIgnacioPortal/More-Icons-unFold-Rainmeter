# Icons Rainmeter unFold
In this repository you will be able to find different icons of the type **unFold** for **Rainmeter**.
## What are the unFold skins? :computer:
The **unFold** skins are buttons that can be added on your desktop to use them as shortcuts.<br />
They have very nice designs and you can add them in the right/left of your desktop.
###### You can have something like this:

## Pre-requirements :clipboard:
Things you need to use this skins on your desktop.
* Have the last version of Rainmeter (this project was developed in version 4.2.0) installed in you PC.
* Have the others unFold buttons (if you don't have them, you can download them [here](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449)).
* Enough space on your disk to clone or download the skins.
* Know the path where the skins of Rainmeter are located.
## Installation :wrench:
Now, you can only go to the [releases](https://github.com/Ruben35/Icons-unFold-Rainmeter/releases) apart and **download** the binary **.rmskin**, then you only need to **execute** the binary and add the skin (if you have already the unFold skin this will upgrade them adding the new buttons),("PinkDev1" adds must be added manually).<br/><br/>
But if you want, you can do it the old way :hammer_and_pick:. <br/><br/>
The steps you need to follow in order to install any button of here are:
1. **Clone** or **download** this project.
2. **Select** the folder of the button you want to add on your desktop.
3. **Paste** the folder in the Skins of Rainmeter in the folder "unFold" (if you still don't have the others unFold buttons you can download them [here](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449)).
4. **Enter** into the folder of the button and select the type of button you want. [ OR: copy the folder "Buttons" to its instance in your computer (EJ: E:\users\CoolUsername\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\unFold\@Resources\Buttons) Just make sure to "skip" the files that are already there when copying with the Windows GUI. (skip to step 6) ]
5. Depending on the type of button (Black, Transparent or White), you need to **copy** the image and **paste** it into the folder "@Resources/Buttons".
6. Now, just **open** Rainmeter, **search** unFold and **load** the button you want. You can change the position of it but this kind of buttons are always in the border right or left of the dektop.
7. If the path of a button doesn't work, probably you should **edit** the file (in each file it has on the top a comment that indicate where you need to change the path) and **write** the correct path of your program.

Now, if you want to try to do your own button you can check the Button Templete in this repository and modify the files of the "Create a new Button" folder.
